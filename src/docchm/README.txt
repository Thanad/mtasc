DocCHM v1.0 - (c)2003 Nicolas Cannasse
======================================

DocCHM is a CHM generator for OCamlDoc. It enable you to generate a CHM file
( Windows CompressedHTML Help file ) instead of the standard HTML output. It
automaticaly generate the index and the hyperlinks to upper module, types, etc.
You can then quickly browse the documentation, and search index by name.

The index contains :
- module names
  . full name ModuleA.ModuleB
  . short name ModuleB ( in ModuleA )
- values names
- type names
- class names
- record fields names
- type constructors
- class attributes names
- class methods names

Installing
----------

Simply copy the file 'docchm.cma' in the folder of your choice.
The full source docchm.ml is provided but since it requires ocamldoc sources
(and since theses require ocaml sources) the bytecode-binary is provided for
the current OCaml version.

In order to compile the CHM file, you need to get and install Microsoft HTML
Help Workshop from Microsoft Website ( it's free ). The HHC.exe executable
file need to be accessible from the command line PATH (ask Google how to
modify your PATH environment variable if you don't know how to do it)

Running
-------

It is recommend to have a two-steps procedure :

- generate a ocamldoc dump from your sources

	example : ocamldoc -dump mydoc.odoc *.mli

    this will generate a 'mydoc.odoc' file that will contains raw ocamldoc
	extracted informations.

- generate the documentation using DocCHM

	example : ocamldoc -load mydoc.odoc -o mydoc.chm -g docchm.cma

	this will generate all the HTML files and then run HHC to compile them
	into a CHM file. Note that docchm.cma is here supposed to be in the
	current directory, you may have to put the full path where you have
	copied docchm.cma ( -g c:\ocaml\bin\docchm.cma for example )

To create one big file containing all the documentation for several modules,
you can simply use '-load' several times, links between the modules types are
automaticaly generated.

Bugs
----

Some rare features are still unsupported by DocCHM, and no plans have been
made to support them. If you're willing to have them supported, the full
sources are included so please modify them and send a patch.

During DocCHM developement and testing, I have experienced some bugs when
running HHC: it was just crashing - access violation. If you're getting this
kind of error, don't ask because I can't do anything for you. Simply try
to add/remove more types/functions/modules/comments to find some way which
does not cause HHC to crash...

Licence
-------

The DocCHM tool is GPL.
Generating documentation using DocCHM does not modify the author (c) on it.
Simply please doesn't remove the notes like "Generated by DocCHM" from your
final documentation.
